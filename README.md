Open LLM Bridge is an open-source project that provides a unified interface for accessing various Language Model (LLM)
APIs. It allows users to configure and utilize different LLM APIs based on their preferences. The project is built using
Python 3.10, FastAPI framework, and runs on Uvicorn.

## Features

- **Stream Support**: Open LLM Bridge supports stream-based data transmission for `/chat/completion`.
- **LLM Bridging**: The project includes support for accessing Azure APIs using the OpenAI API format, facilitating seamless integration with Azure LLM services.
- **Token Billing**: The project includes token-based billing functionality based on [TikToken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken), allowing users to effectively manage and track their API usage and costs.
